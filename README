= Blog

This is a mashup of extensions, aiming to provide a good basis for blogging.
It uses:

* Admin Tree Structure

Alters the page index view for children of ArchivePages. They are split up per year and month, keep a better overview.

* Blog tags

Adds several tags that come in handy for building your blog pages. I also added an r:archive_list tag which depends on the a_t_s extension.

This extension also has some tweaks to play nice with SiteLanguage extension.
